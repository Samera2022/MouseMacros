# Privacy Policy for MouseMacros

**Last Updated: January 30, 2026**

Samera2022 ("we", "us", or "our") provides **MouseMacros** as a **Free and Open Source** application. This service is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

### 1. No Data Collection
We believe in absolute privacy. **MouseMacros does not collect, harvest, transmit, or store any personal identifiable information (PII).** There are no hidden analytics, tracking scripts, or telemetry embedded in the software.

### 2. Purely Local Operation
The application operates entirely on your local machine. No data is ever uploaded to a server or "the cloud."
*   **Macro Files (.mmc):** Your recorded mouse and keyboard sequences are saved as local `.mmc` files only when you explicitly click "Save." These files remain under your total control.
*   **No Network Access:** The application does not require or use an internet connection for its core functions.

### 3. Local Configuration and Storage
To provide a better user experience, the app stores small configuration files in your system's `AppData` directory (`%USERPROFILE%/AppData/MouseMacros/`):
*   **config.cfg**: Remembers your UI language, theme mode (Dark/Light), and custom hotkey mappings.
*   **cache.json**: Remembers technical details like window dimensions and the last directory you used to open macros.
    These files stay on your computer and can be manually deleted by the user at any time.

### 4. System Permissions Usage
To function as an automation tool, MouseMacros requires the following local system access:
*   **Input Monitoring:** The app listens to mouse and keyboard events only when you are in "Recording" or "Playing" mode. This data is processed in real-time to perform the automation and is never stored in the background.
*   **System Settings:** The app detects your system's language and theme preferences solely to adjust its user interface for your convenience.

### 5. Open Source Transparency
As an open-source project, our source code is publicly available for audit. Users and developers are welcome to inspect the code to verify our privacy claims.

Our documentation or GitHub page may contain links to other sites (e.g., Discord). If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content or privacy policies of any third-party sites or services.
